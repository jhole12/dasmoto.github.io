My first independent project through Codecademy using VS Code instead of the internal coding environment I had been using in Codecasemy.
I learned how to solve problems on the spot using code, how to troubleshoot in a web browser, and how to link local files to a website. I had to search MDN documentation and other forums to solve some of my hangups. I started learning to code HTML in November 2023, and started daily practice in January 2024. One thing in particular that was tricky for me was learning the precise way of writing relative URLs to link to files I needed.
